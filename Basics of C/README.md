C Language Tutorial for Beginners

Welcome to the C Language Tutorial for Beginners! This repository contains a series of lessons designed to teach you the fundamentals of the C programming language.

Overview
This tutorial is aimed at beginners who have little or no programming experience. It starts with the basics of setting up a development environment and writing your first "Hello, World!" program. From there, we will cover the following topics:

Variables and data types
Operators and expressions
Control structures (if/else, switch/case, loops)
Functions
Arrays
Pointers
Structs and unions
File I/O
Dynamic Memory Allocation

Each lesson builds on the previous one, so it's recommended that you go through them in order. We'll also provide plenty of examples and exercises to help you practice and reinforce your understanding.

Prerequisites
Before you get started, you'll need the following:

A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Code::Blocks
A C compiler installed on your computer, such as GCC or Clang
If you need help with setting up your development environment, don't worry! We'll provide step-by-step instructions in the first lesson.
